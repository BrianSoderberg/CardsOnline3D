The Hakem will be dealt to first<comma> choose the trump suit<comma> and lead the first trick.  <LF><LF>Cards continue to be dealt to the other three players until another Ace is revealed.  The player that receives the second Ace is the Hakem’s partner.  The other two players are on a team with each other.  Partners should sit across from each other.<LF><LF>The player seated to the right of the Hakem deals 13 cards to each player.  The cards are dealt in packets of 5<comma> 4<comma> and 4.

(Some variant games use multiple packs or add a few cards called jokers.) The cards are ranked (from high to low) Ace<comma> King<comma> Queen<comma> Jack<comma> 10<comma> 9<comma> 8<comma> 7<comma> 6<comma> 5<comma> 4<comma> 3<comma> 2<comma> Ace. (Ace can be high or low<comma> but is usually high). There are four suits (spades<comma> hearts<comma> diamonds and clubs); however<comma> no suit is higher than another. All poker hands contain five cards<comma> the highest hand wins.<LF>Some games have Wild Cards<comma> which can take on whatever suit and rank their possessor desires. Sometimes jokers will be used as wild cards<comma> other times<comma> the game will specify which cards are wild (dueces<comma> one-eyed jacks<comma> or whatever).<LF><LF>How the hands are ranked<LF>:<LF>Hands are ranked as follows (from high to low):<LF>Five of a Kind<LF>Straight Flush<LF>Four of a Kind<LF>Full House<LF>Flush<LF>Straight<LF>Three of a Kind<LF>Two Pair<LF>Pair<LF>High Card<LF><LF>Descriptions of Hand Ranks<LF>Five of a Kind<LF>A five of a kind (which is only possible when using wild cards) is the highest possible hand. If more than one hand has five of a kind<comma> the higher card wins (Five Aces beats five kings<comma> which beat five queens<comma> and so on).<LF><LF>Straight Flush<LF>A straight flush is the best natural hand. A straight flush is a straight (5 cards in order<comma> such as 5-6-7-8-9) that are all of the same suit. As in a regular straight<comma> you can have an ace either high (A-K-Q-J-T) or low (5-4-3-2-1). However<comma> a straight may not 'wraparound'. (Such as K-A-2-3-4<comma> which is not a straight). An Ace high straight-flush is called a Royal Flush and is the highest natural hand.<LF><LF>Four of a Kind<LF>Four of a kind is simply four cards of the same rank. If there are two or more hands that qualify<comma> the hand with the higher-rank four of a kind wins. If<comma> in some bizarre game with many wild cards<comma> there are two four of a kinds with the same rank<comma> then the one with the high card outside the four of the kind wins. General Rule: When hands tie on the rank of a pair<comma> three of a kind<comma> etc<comma> the cards outside break ties following the High Card rules.<LF><LF>Full House<LF>A full house is a three of a kind and a pair<comma> such as K-K-K-5-5. Ties are broken first by the three of a kind<comma> then pair. So K-K-K-2-2 beats Q-Q-Q-A-A<comma> which beats Q-Q-Q-J-J. (Obviously<comma> the three of a kind can only be similiar if wild cards are used.)<LF><LF>Flush<LF>A flush is a hand where all of the cards are the same suit<comma> such as J-8-5-3-2<comma> all of spades. When flushes ties<comma> follow the rules for High Card.<LF><LF>Straight<LF>A straight is 5 cards in order<comma> such as 4-5-6-7-8. An ace may either be high (A-K-Q-J-T) or low (5-4-3-2-1). However<comma> a straight may not 'wraparound'. (Such as Q-K-A-2-3<comma> which is not a straight). When straights tie<comma> the highest straight wins. (AKQJT beats KQJT9 down to 5432A). If two straights have the same value (AKQJT vs AKQJT) they split the pot.<LF><LF>Three of a Kind<LF>Three cards of any rank<comma> matched with two cards that are not a pair (otherwise it would be a Full House . Again<comma> highest three of a kind wins. If both are the same rank<comma> then the compare High Cards.<LF><LF>Two Pair<LF>This is two distinct pairs of card and a 5th card. The highest pair wins ties. If both hands have the same high pair<comma> the second pair wins. If both hands have the same pairs<comma> the high card wins.<LF><LF>Pair<LF>One pair with three distinct cards. High card breaks ties.<LF><LF>High Card<LF>This is any hand which doesn't qualify as any one of the above hands. If nobody has a pair or better<comma> then the highest card wins. If multiple people tie for the highest card<comma> they look at the second highest<comma> then the third highest etc. High card is also used to break ties when the high hands both have the same type of hand (pair<comma> flush<comma> straight<comma> etc).<LF><LF>Betting<LF>So<comma> how do you bet? Poker is<comma> after all<comma> a gambling game. In most games<comma> you must 'ante' something (amount varies by game<comma> our games are typically a nickel)<comma> just to get dealt cards. After that players bet into the pot in the middle. At the end of the hand<comma> the highest hand (that hasn't folded) wins the pot. Basically<comma> when betting gets around to you (betting is typically done in clockwise order)<comma> you have one of three choices:<LF><LF>Call<LF>When you call<comma> you bet enough to match what has been bet since the last time you bet (for instance<comma> if you bet a dime last time<comma> and someone else bet a quarter<comma> you would owe fifteen cents).<LF><LF>Raise<LF>When you raise<comma> you first bet enough to match what has been bet since the last time you bet (as in calling)<comma> then you 'raise' the bet another amount (up to you<comma> but there is typically a limit.) Continuing the above example<comma> if you had bet a dime<comma> the other person raised you fifteen cents (up to a quarter)<comma> you might raise a quarter (up to fifty cents). Since you owed the pot 15 cents for calling and 25 for your raise<comma> you would put 40 cents into the pot.<LF><LF>Fold<LF>When you fold<comma> you drop out of the current hand (losing any possibility of winning the pot)<comma> but you don't have to put any money into the pot.<LF>Betting continues until everyone calls or folds after a raise or initial bet.

The entire deck is dealt one at a time<comma> face down<comma> beginning on the dealer's left. The players then pick up their cards and arrange them by suits.<LF><LF>THE BIDDING<LF>Each player decides how many tricks they will be able to take. The player to the dealer's left starts the bidding and<comma> in turn<comma> each player states how many tricks they expect to win. There is only one round of bidding<comma> and the minimum bid is One. Every player must make a bid; no player may pass. No suit is named in the bid<comma> for as the name of the game implies<comma> spades are always trump.<LF><LF>THE PLAY<LF>The game is scored by hands<comma> and the winner must make a certain number of points<comma> which is decided before the game begins. Five hundred points is common<comma> but 200 points is suitable for a short game. The player on the dealer's left makes the opening lead<comma> and players must follow suit<comma> if possible. If a player cannot follow suit<comma> they may play a trump or discard. The trick is won by the player who plays the highest trump or if no trump was played<comma> the player who played the highest card in the suit led. The player who wins the trick leads next. Play continues until none of the players have any cards left. Each hand is worth 13 tricks. Spades cannot be led unless played previously or player to lead has nothing but Spades in his hand.<LF><LF>HOW TO KEEP SCORE<LF>For making the contract (the number of tricks bid)<comma> the player scores 10 points for each trick bid<comma> plus 1 point for each overtrick.<LF><LF>For example<comma> if the player's bid is Seven and they make seven tricks<comma> the score would be 70. If the bid was Five and the player won eight tricks<comma> the score would be 53 points: 50 points for the bid<comma> and 3 points for the three overtricks. In some games<comma> overtricks are called ""bags"" and a deduction of 100 points is made every time a player accumulates 10 bags. Thus<comma> the object is always to fulfill the bid exactly.<LF><LF>If the player ""breaks contract<comma>"" that is<comma> if they take fewer than the number of tricks bid<comma> the score is 0. For example<comma> if a player bids Four and wins only three tricks<comma> no points are awarded.<LF>One of the players is the scorer and writes the bids down<comma> so that during the play and for the scoring afterward<comma> this information will be available to all the players. When a hand is over<comma> the scores should be recorded next to the bids<comma> and a running score should be kept so that players can readily see each other's total points. If there is a tie<comma> then all players participate in one more round of play."

When one player hits the agreed-upon score or higher<comma> the game ends; and the player with the lowest score wins.<LF><LF>CARD VALUES/SCORING<LF>At the end of each hand<comma> players count the number of hearts they have taken as well as the queen of spades<comma> if applicable. Hearts count as one point each and the queen counts 13 points.<LF>Each heart - 1 point<LF>The Q - 13 points<LF>The aggregate total of all scores for each hand must be a multiple of 26.<LF>The game is usually played to 100 points (some play to 50).<LF>When a player takes all 13 hearts and the queen of spades in one hand<comma> instead of losing 26 points<comma> that player scores zero and each of his opponents score an additional 26 points.<LF><LF>THE DEAL<LF>Deal the cards one at a time<comma> face down<comma> clockwise. In a four-player game<comma> each is dealt 13 cards; in a three-player game<comma> the 2 of diamonds should be removed<comma> and each player gets 17 cards; in a five-player game<comma> the 2 of clubs should be removed so that each player will get 10 cards.<LF><LF>THE PLAY<LF>The player holding the 2 of clubs after the pass makes the opening lead. If the 2 has been removed for the three handed game<comma> then the 3 of clubs is led.<LF><LF>Each player must follow suit if possible. If a player is void of the suit led<comma> a card of any other suit may be discarded. However<comma> if a player has no clubs when the first trick is led<comma> a heart or the queen of spades cannot be discarded.

Face cards are 10 and any other card is its pip value.<LF><LF>BETTING<LF>Before the deal begins<comma> each player places a bet<comma> in chips<comma> in front of them in the designated area. Minimum and maximum limits are established on the betting<comma> and the general limits are from $2 to $500.<LF><LF>THE SHUFFLE AND CUT<LF>The dealer thoroughly shuffles portions of the pack until all the cards have been mixed and combined. The dealer designates one of the players to cut<comma> and the plastic insert card is placed so that the last 60 to 75 cards or so will not be used. (Not dealing to the bottom of all the cards makes it more difficult for professional card counters to operate effectively.)<LF><LF>THE DEAL<LF>When all the players have placed their bets<comma> the dealer gives one card face up to each player in rotation clockwise<comma> and then one card face up to themselves. Another round of cards is then dealt face up to each player<comma> but the dealer takes the second card face down. Thus<comma> each player except the dealer receives two cards face up<comma> and the dealer receives one card face up and one card face down. (In some games<comma> played with only one deck<comma> the players' cards are dealt face down and they get to hold them. Today<comma> however<comma> virtually all Blackjack games feature the players' cards dealt face up on the condition that no player may touch any cards.)<LF><LF>NATURALS<LF>If a player's first two cards are an ace and a ""ten-card"" (a picture card or 10)<comma> giving a count of 21 in two cards<comma> this is a natural or ""blackjack."" If any player has a natural and the dealer does not<comma> the dealer immediately pays that player one and a half times the amount of their bet. If the dealer has a natural<comma> they immediately collect the bets of all players who do not have naturals<comma> (but no additional amount). If the dealer and another player both have naturals<comma> the bet of that player is a stand-off (a tie)<comma> and the player takes back his chips.<LF><LF>If the dealer's face-up card is a ten-card or an ace<comma> they look at their face-down card to see if the two cards make a natural. If the face-up card is not a ten-card or an ace<comma> they do not look at the face-down card until it is the dealer's turn to play.<LF><LF>THE PLAY<LF>The player to the left goes first and must decide whether to ""stand"" (not ask for another card) or ""hit"" (ask for another card in an attempt to get closer to a count of 21<comma> or even hit 21 exactly). Thus<comma> a player may stand on the two cards originally dealt to them<comma> or they may ask the dealer for additional cards<comma> one at a time<comma> until deciding to stand on the total (if it is 21 or under)<comma> or goes ""bust"" (if it is over 21). In the latter case<comma> the player loses and the dealer collects the bet wagered. The dealer then turns to the next player to their left and serves them in the same manner.<LF><LF>The combination of an ace with a card other than a ten-card is known as a ""soft hand<comma>"" because the player can count the ace as a 1 or 11<comma> and either draw cards or not. For example with a ""soft 17"" (an ace and a 6)<comma> the total is 7 or 17. While a count of 17 is a good hand<comma> the player may wish to draw for a higher total. If the draw creates a bust hand by counting the ace as an 11<comma> the player simply counts the ace as a 1 and continues playing by standing or ""hitting"" (asking the dealer for additional cards<comma> one at a time).<LF><LF>THE DEALER'S PLAY<LF>When the dealer has served every player<comma> the dealers face-down card is turned up. If the total is 17 or more<comma> it must stand. If the total is 16 or under<comma> they must take a card. The dealer must continue to take cards until the total is 17 or more<comma> at which point the dealer must stand. If the dealer has an ace<comma> and counting it as 11 would bring the total to 17 or more (but not over 21)<comma> the dealer must count the ace as 11 and stand. The dealer's decisions<comma> then<comma> are automatic on all plays<comma> whereas the player always has the option of taking one or more cards.<LF><LF>SIGNALING INTENTIONS<LF>When a player's turn comes<comma> they can say ""Hit"" or can signal for a card by scratching the table with a finger or two in a motion toward themselves<comma> or they can wave their hand in the same motion that would say to someone ""Come here!"" When the player decides to stand<comma> they can say ""Stand"" or ""No more<comma>"" or can signal this intention by moving their hand sideways<comma> palm down and just above the table.<LF><LF>SPLITTING PAIRS<LF>If a player's first two cards are of the same denomination<comma> such as two jacks or two sixes<comma> they may choose to treat them as two separate hands when their turn comes around. The amount of the original bet then goes on one of the cards<comma> and an equal amount must be placed as a bet on the other card. The player first plays the hand to their left by standing or hitting one or more times; only then is the hand to the right played. The two hands are thus treated separately<comma> and the dealer settles with each on its own merits. With a pair of aces<comma> the player is given one card for each ace and may not draw again. Also<comma> if a ten-card is dealt to one of these aces<comma> the payoff is equal to the bet (not one and one-half to one<comma> as with a blackjack at any other time).<LF><LF>DOUBLING DOWN<LF>Another option open to the player is doubling their bet when the original two cards dealt total 9<comma> 10<comma> or 11. When the player's turn comes<comma> they place a bet equal to the original bet<comma> and the dealer gives the player just one card<comma> which is placed face down and is not turned up until the bets are settled at the end of the hand. With two fives<comma> the player may split a pair<comma> double down<comma> or just play the hand in the regular way. Note that the dealer does not have the option of splitting or doubling down.<LF><LF>INSURANCE<LF>When the dealer's face-up card is an ace<comma> any of the players may make a side bet of up to half the original bet that the dealer's face-down card is a ten-card<comma> and thus a blackjack for the house. Once all such side bets are placed<comma> the dealer looks at the hole card. If it is a ten-card<comma> it is turned up<comma> and those players who have made the insurance bet win and are paid double the amount of their half-bet - a 2 to 1 payoff. When a blackjack occurs for the dealer<comma> of course<comma> the hand is over<comma> and the players' main bets are collected - unless a player also has blackjack<comma> in which case it is a stand-off. Insurance is invariably not a good proposition for the player<comma> unless they are quite sure that there are an unusually high number of ten-cards still left undealt.<LF><LF>SETTLEMENT<LF>A bet once paid and collected is never returned. Thus<comma> one key advantage to the dealer is that the player goes first. If the player goes bust<comma> they have already lost their wager<comma> even if the dealer goes bust as well. If the dealer goes over 21<comma> the dealer pays each player who has stood the amount of that player's bet. If the dealer stands at 21 or less<comma> the dealer pays the bet of any player having a higher total (not exceeding 21) and collects the bet of any player having a lower total. If there is a stand-off (a player having the same total as the dealer)<comma> no chips are paid out or collected.<LF><LF>RESHUFFLING<LF>When each player's bet is settled<comma> the dealer gathers in that player's cards and places them face up at the side against a clear plastic L-shaped shield. The dealer continues to deal from the shoe until coming to the plastic insert card<comma> which indicates that it is time to reshuffle. Once that round of play is over<comma> the dealer shuffles all the cards<comma> prepares them for the cut<comma> places the cards in the shoe<comma> and the game continues.<LF><LF>BASIC STRATEGY<LF>Winning tactics in Blackjack require that the player play each hand in the optimum way<comma> and such strategy always takes into account what the dealer's upcard is. When the dealer's upcard is a good one<comma> a 7<comma> 8<comma> 9<comma> 10-card<comma> or ace for example<comma> the player should not stop drawing until a total of 17 or more is reached. When the dealer's upcard is a poor one<comma> 4<comma> 5<comma> or 6<comma> the player should stop drawing as soon as he gets a total of 12 or higher. The strategy here is never to take a card if there is any chance of going bust. The desire with this poor holding is to let the dealer hit and hopefully go over 21. Finally<comma> when the dealer's up card is a fair one<comma> 2 or 3<comma> the player should stop with a total of 13 or higher.<LF><LF>With a soft hand<comma> the general strategy is to keep hitting until a total of at least 18 is reached. Thus<comma> with an ace and a six (7 or 17)<comma> the player would not stop at 17<comma> but would hit.<LF><LF>The basic strategy for doubling down is as follows: With a total of 11<comma> the player should always double down. With a total of 10<comma> he should double down unless the dealer shows a ten-card or an ace. With a total of 9<comma> the player should double down only if the dealer's card is fair or poor (2 through 6).<LF><LF>For splitting<comma> the player should always split a pair of aces or 8s; identical ten-cards should not be split<comma> and neither should a pair of 5s<comma> since two 5s are a total of 10<comma> which can be used more effectively in doubling down. A pair of 4s should not be split either<comma> as a total of 8 is a good number to draw to. Generally<comma> 2s<comma> 3s<comma> or 7s can be split unless the dealer has an 8<comma> 9<comma> ten-card<comma> or ace. Finally<comma> 6s should not be split unless the dealer's card is poor (2 through 6)."

Unexpectedly<comma> it also has similarities to the popular kid’s game War. The game’s origin is from the French game Bezique. Non-French speakers adopted the name ‘Binocle’ for the game<comma> which means eyeglasses in French. German immigrants who adopted the game mispronounced it as “pinochle” and brought that name with them to America where the game subsequently spread.<LF><LF>THE DECK<LF>The Pinochle deck has 48 cards. In each of the four suits<comma> the deck has two of each: A<comma> K<comma> Q<comma> J<comma> 10<comma> and 9. These cards<comma> however<comma> do not follow the traditional ranking. Ace is high<comma> followed by 10<comma> and K<comma> and are often referred to as counters. Meaning these cards are always worth points. There are several methods of scoring which will be outlined below in the scoring section<comma> some of which include Q<comma> J<comma> 9 as both being worth points and as NOT being worth points. When these cards are valued at 0 points<comma> they are referred to as noncounters. The mechanism of scoring must be mutually agreed upon before the deal and the play.<LF><LF>THE DEAL<LF>A dealer may be chosen by whatever method players wish. They then will shuffle the cards thoroughly and distribute 12 cards to each player<comma> 3 or 4 cards at a time. The deal starts to the left of the dealer and moves clockwise<comma> ending with their own set of cards.<LF><LF>Once each player has their hand<comma> they examine their cards and prepare for the auction or bidding phase. <LF><LF>*If playing without bidding<comma> after the deal<comma> the dealer flips over the top card of the deck and places it face-up on the table. The suit of this card is the trump suit and all cards of that suit beat cards of all other suits. High ranking trump cards beat other trump cards. The remainder of the deck is placed face-down on the table and is the stockpile. <LF><LF>THE AUCTION/THE BID<LF>A bid is a prediction of the number of points your hand might earn. The player who bids the highest<comma> or the winner of the bid<comma> has the following perks:<LF>- declare trump suit<LF>- receive cards from their partner<LF>- lead the first trick<LF><LF>The minimum bid players must make is 250 points. Bids increase by factors of 10 and consist only of a number. The bid goes around the table until each player passes and a winner is declared. Starting to the left of the dealer<comma> and moving clockwise<comma> player’s have the following options during bidding:<LF><LF>- bid normally<comma> by bidding 10 points higher than the previous bid<LF>- give a jump bid<comma> and bid 20 points higher than the previous bid<LF>- pass and leave the bidding<LF>OR:<LF>- pass with help<comma> which means you pass but you are giving extra information to your partner.<LF><LF>After the winner emerges<comma> they announce the trump suit.<LF><LF>PASSING CARDS<LF>The winner of the bid and their partner have the right to exchange cards. The winner’s partner selects exactly four cards to pass to their partner. The declarer (winner of the bid) adds those four cards to hand and examines them. After<comma> they send back four cards to their partner<comma> which can include sending back some cards they just received.<LF><LF>MELDING<LF> After the passing of cards<comma> all four players can place their melds on the table. Melds are made of particular card combinations<comma> each combination having its own point value. There are various types of melds which players can create including arounds<comma> flushes<comma> marriages<comma> and pinochle. <LF><LF>AROUNDS<LF>Aces (100 Aces) – four Aces<comma> different suits – 10 or 100 points<LF>Kings (80 Kings) – four Kings<comma> different suits  – 8 or 80 points<LF>Queens (60 Queens) – four Queens<comma> different suits – 6 or 60 points<LF>Jacks (40 Jacks) – four Jacks<comma> different suits – 4 or 40 points<LF>Aces (1000 Aces) – eight Aces – 100 or 1000 points<LF>Kings (800 Kings) – eight Kings – 80 or 800 points<LF>Queens (600 Queens) – eight Queens – 60 or 600 points<LF>Jacks (400 Jacks) – eight Jacks – 40 or 400 points<LF><LF>MARRIAGES & FLUSHES<LF>Marriages and Flushes are the sequence combinations.<LF>Trump – K and Q of Trump suit – 4 or 40 points<comma> 8 or 80 points if double<LF>Marriage – K and Q of any suit – 2 or 20 points<comma> 4 or 40 points if double<LF>Marriages around – K and Q in each suit – 24 or 240 points<LF>Flush (run) – A<comma> 10<comma> K<comma> Q in trump suit – 15 or 150 points<comma> 150 or 1500 if double<LF><LF>PINOCHLES<LF>Pinochle – J of diamonds and Q of spades – 4 or 40 points<LF>Double – both J of diamonds and Q of spades – 30 or 300 points<LF>Dix – 9 in trump suit – 1 or 10 points<LF><LF>Once each player sets their melds out they are scored and recorded on the scoring pad.<LF><LF>Since there are a maximum of 250 points available in the trick-taking phase of the game<comma> if the declarer is 250+ points under their bid after melding they may throw in their cards and not participate in the trick-taking whatsoever.<LF><LF>If their bid is within 250 points after melding they may play their hand in the trick-taking.<LF><LF>TRICK-TAKING<LF>After the melds have been scored players pick up their hands and prepare for the trick-taking portion of the game. The declarer leads the initial trick by playing any card they wish. A trick is won by playing either the highest ranking trump card or<comma> if there are no trumps<comma> the highest ranking card that follows the suit led with. During a trick<comma> each player plays exactly one card. This continues until all 12 tricks have been played. Each trick after the first trick is led by the winner of the previous trick. <LF><LF>Trick-taking follows the rules below:<LF>When you can follow suit you must. If you have a card in hand the matches the suit lead with you must play it. Play a higher ranking card than the lead if possible.<LF>If you are unable to follow suit<comma> but a have a card in hand from the trump suit<comma> you must play that card. This is called trumping the trick. If the suit led with was a trump play a higher ranking trump card if possible.<LF>In the event you can neither follow suit or play a trump<comma> you may slough. This means playing any card at all.<LF>Each team should designate a puller. This player will collect the cards from tricks won in a face-down pile in front of them for scoring later in the game.<LF><LF>SCORING<LF>After all twelve tricks are played players score the cards collected. Aces<comma> 10s<comma> and Kings are worth 10 points each. Winning the final trick is also worth 10 points. This gives a total of 250 points players can collect during trick taking.
